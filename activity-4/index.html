          The Galaxy s25+ is the best phone I have ever had. It is fast, the
          camera is amazing and the design is really cool. I got it a few weeks
          ago and it is the best experience I have ever had with a cellphone.

          I didn't like it. I have always use Apple and for the first time I
          tried a Samsung, worst experience ever. I will never buy a Samsung
          phone again.
